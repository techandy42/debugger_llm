The buggy code modifies the original list in-place, which may not be desired. To fix this, we should use the sorted() function instead of .sort() to return a new sorted list.\n\n3. The use of nums.index(x) as a secondary sort key is unnecessary and can be inefficient for large lists. The stable sorting algorithm used by Python's sorted() function already preserves the original order for equal elements.\n\nTo fix these issues, we should implement a separate digits_sum function that correctly handles negative numbers, and use sorted() with this function as the key.\n<\/bug_analysis_2>"},{"role":"metadata","content":{"model":"claude-instant-1.2","task_id":"HumanEval\/145","bug_analysis_1":"rd4","bug_analysis_2":"rd5"}}]}
