TASK ID: HumanEval/85

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Missing Return Statement:
- As outlined in the function description, the function should return the computed result.
- The buggy code is missing the return statement to return the result of the line `sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)`.
- To fix this, add a return statement to line `sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)`.
