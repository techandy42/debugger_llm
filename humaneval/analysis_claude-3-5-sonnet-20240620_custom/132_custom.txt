TASK ID: HumanEval/132

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The lines following the line `stack = []` have an addition level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of Indentation from all of the lines following the line `stack = []`.

2. Logic Error:
- The buggy code checks if there is equal or more number of opening brackets than closing brackets in a series of nested brackets, without checking if the nested brackets close properly.
- For example, the buggy code will return True for the input `[[]` which is incorrect.
- To fix this, keep track of the current level of nesting, and if the series of brackets up to the current point fully closes, update the maximum level of nesting and reset the current level of nesting. Return True if the maximum level of nesting is two or more. The following is an example of the correct implementation:
```python
stack = []
max_nesting_level = 0
cur_nesting_level = 0
for bracket in string:
    if bracket == '[':
        stack.append(bracket)
    elif bracket == ']' and stack:
        if stack:
            cur_nesting_level += 1 
        stack.pop()
        if not stack:
            max_nesting_level = max(max_nesting_level, cur_nesting_level)
            cur_nesting_level = 0
return max_nesting_level >= 2
```
