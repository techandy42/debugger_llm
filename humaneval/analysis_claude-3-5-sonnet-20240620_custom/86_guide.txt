GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())` and `''.join(char for char in word if not char.isalnum())`

These lines separate alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, which is unnecessary and incorrect. All characters should be sorted together.

2. `ordered_alpha + non_alpha`

This line reattaches the non-alphabetic characters at the end, which is incorrect. All characters should be sorted together.

To fix these issues, replace the entire loop with a list comprehension that sorts all characters in each word:

`[''.join(sorted(list(word))) for word in s.split()]`

This correctly sorts all characters in each word while maintaining word order and spaces.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains the following issue:

"`alpha = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())`
`non_alpha = ''.join(char for char in word if not char.isalnum())`
`ordered_alpha = ''.join(sorted(alpha))`
`ordered_word = ordered_alpha + non_alpha`"

This approach separates alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters, sorts only the alphanumeric ones, and then concatenates them. This is incorrect as it changes the relative positions of non-alphanumeric characters.

To fix this, we should sort all characters in each word, regardless of whether they are alphanumeric or not. The correct implementation is:

`return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])`

This sorts all characters in each word while maintaining the order of words and spaces in the sentence.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code contains one main issue:

"`alpha = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())`"
"`non_alpha = ''.join(char for char in word if not char.isalnum())`"
"`ordered_alpha = ''.join(sorted(alpha))`"
"`ordered_word = ordered_alpha + non_alpha`"

This approach separates alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters, sorts only the alphanumeric ones, and then concatenates them. This is incorrect as it doesn't maintain the original order of non-alphanumeric characters within the word.

To fix this, we should sort all characters in each word, regardless of whether they're alphanumeric or not. The correct implementation is:

`''.join(sorted(list(word)))`

This sorts all characters in the word based on their ASCII values, maintaining the correct order for all character types.
