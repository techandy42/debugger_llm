TASK ID: HumanEval/121

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Missing Return statement:
- According to the function description, the function should return an integer.
- However, the buggy code is missing the `return` statement to return the computed value.
- To fix this, add `return` at the beginning of the line `sum(num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 != 0)`.
