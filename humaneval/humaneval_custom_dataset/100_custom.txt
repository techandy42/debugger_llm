TASK ID: HumanEval/100

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Logic:
- The buggy code is incrementing the number of stones by 1 for odd number of stones.
- However, in order to next the next odd/even number, the correct approach is to add 2 to the current number of stones regardless of odd/even.
- To fix this, replace the `if` and `else` statements under the `for _ in range(1, n):` line with `current += 2`. The for loop should now look like:
```python
for _ in range(1, n):
    current += 2
    pile.append(current)
```
