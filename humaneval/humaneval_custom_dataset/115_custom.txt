TASK ID: HumanEval/115

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Logic:
- The function description states that each row of the grid is a well.
- However, the buggy code is treating the entire grid as a single well, which is not true.
- To fix this, the number of times the bucket must be lowered should be calculated for each row of the grid, then summed afterwards.
- A potential solution could be:
```python
total_bucket_use = sum(math.ceil(sum(row)/capacity) for row in grid)
return total_bucket_use
```
