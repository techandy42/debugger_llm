TASK ID: HumanEval/122

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Assumption:
- The line `if 1 <= arr[i] <= 99:` only accounts for positive integers with two or less digits.
- The code should account for inputs that are negative as well.
- To fix this, wrap `arr[i]` with `abs` function to check if the integer has two or less digits, regardless of whether it's positive or not.

Furthermore, given the constraints in the function description, the `min(k, len(arr))` is line `for i in range(min(k, len(arr)))` is unnecessary and can be replaced with `k`. However, this does not cause runtime issue.
