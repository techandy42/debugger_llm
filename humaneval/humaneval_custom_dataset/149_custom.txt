TASK ID: HumanEval/149

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Non-Code Comment in Code:
- The comment `Here's the implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function based on the provided docstring:` does not have a comment symbol in front of it, which causes runtime error.
- To fix this, remove the comment entirely, or add a comment symbol `#` in front of it.

2. Incorrect Indentation:
- The line `return sorted([word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0], key=lambda x: (len(x), x))` contains an additional level of indentation compared to the comments in the function description, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of indentation from the line.
