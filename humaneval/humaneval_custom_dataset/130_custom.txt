TASK ID: HumanEval/130

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Index Error
- The `result[i + 1]` code snippet in line `result.append(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i + 1])` causes an index error since i is pointing to the last index in the result.
- To fix this, replace `result[i + 1]` with `(i + 3) /2`, which properly adds the next value without causing the index error. After the change, the line should look like:
```python
result.append(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)
```

2. Edge Case for Variable Initializable Value
- The initial value for result is `[1, 3, 2]` in the buggy code, which returns `[1, 3, 2]` given n = 1, which is incorrect.
- To fix this, initialize the result list with `[1, 3]` instead of `[1, 3, 2]`, and replace `3` with `2` inside the line `for i in range(3, n + 1)`. After the changes, those two lines should look like:
```python
result = [1, 3]
for i in range(2, n + 1):
```
