TASK ID: HumanEval/86

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Unnecessary Separation Between Alphabet and Non-alphabet Characters:
- The buggy code separates alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, which is not required in the function description, and will output incorrect answers.
- To fix this, remove all code that separates the alphabet characters from non-alphabet characters. The code within the line `for word in words:` should only contain the following, for example:
```python
ordered_words.append(''.join(sorted(word)))
```
