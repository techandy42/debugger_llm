ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
The buggy code has one issue:

`for bracket in brackets:` is indented incorrectly. It should be at the same level as `stack = []`.

To fix this, simply remove the extra indentation before the for loop. The correct implementation uses a depth counter instead of a stack, which is more efficient, but the stack-based approach is also valid if implemented correctly.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code has one indentation issue:

`for bracket in brackets:` and the subsequent lines are indented unnecessarily. They should be aligned with the `stack = []` line.

To fix this, simply remove the extra indentation for these lines. The correct implementation uses a `depth` variable instead of a stack, incrementing it for '<' and decrementing for '>', returning False if depth becomes negative, and True if depth is 0 at the end.
