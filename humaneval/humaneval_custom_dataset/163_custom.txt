TASK ID: HumanEval/163

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Not Considering Examples
- In the provided examples in the function description, the function should only consider even digits between a and b that are within the range [2, 8] (inclusive).
- The buggy code does not consider this.
- To fix this, modify the line `start, end = min(a, b), max(a, b)` so that the `start` is at least 2, and `end` is at most 8. The modified line may look something like:
```python
start, end = max(2, min(a, b)), min(8, max(a, b))
```
