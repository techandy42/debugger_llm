TASK ID: HumanEval/131

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Conditional statement:
- In line `return result if result != 1 else 0`, if the result after computing the product of odd digits is 1, then the function will return 0, which is incorrect.
- To fix this, add a boolean variable to check if some value has been multiplied to the result. If this is true, return the result as it is even if it is 1. The code after fixing the issue might look like:
```python
result = 1
    changed = False
    while n > 0:
        digit = n % 10
        if digit % 2 != 0:
            result *= digit
            changed = True
        n //= 10
    return 0 if result == 1 and not changed else result
```
