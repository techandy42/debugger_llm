GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    result = []

    for i in range(len(string)):
        result.append(string[:i+1])
    return result

BUGGY SOLUTION:
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []
        for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):
            prefixes.append(string[:i])
        return prefixes

ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
There are two bugs in the buggy code:

1. `prefixes = []` is not properly indented. It should be aligned with the function body.

2. The range in the for loop starts from 1 instead of 0: `for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)`.

To fix these issues:
1. Correct the indentation of `prefixes = []`.
2. Change the range to start from 0: `for i in range(len(string))`.
3. Adjust the slicing to `string[:i+1]` to include the correct prefix lengths.

These changes will make the function behave correctly, returning all prefixes from shortest to longest.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
There are two bugs in the buggy code:

1. `for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):`: This range starts from 1 instead of 0, causing the first prefix (single character) to be missed. To fix this, change it to `range(len(string))`.

2. Indentation error: The entire for loop and return statement are incorrectly indented. They should be aligned with the `prefixes = []` line.

To fix these issues, adjust the range and correct the indentation as shown in the correct implementation.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `prefixes = []`: This line is not indented correctly. It should be aligned with the function body.

2. `for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):`: The range should start from 0 instead of 1 to include all prefixes.

To fix these issues:
1. Remove the indentation before `prefixes = []`.
2. Change the range to `range(len(string))` and use `string[:i+1]` in the append statement.

These changes will ensure all prefixes are included, starting from the shortest to the longest.
