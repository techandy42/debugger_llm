TASK ID: HumanEval/63

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The lines following the line `if n < 2:` contains an additional level of indentation, which causes runtime error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of indentation from all of the lines following the line `if n < 2:`.
