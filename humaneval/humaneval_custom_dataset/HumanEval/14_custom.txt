TASK ID: HumanEval/14

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue.

1. Identation Issue:
- The lines following the line `prefixes = []` have an additional level of indentation, which causes runtime error.
- To fix this, remove a level of indentation from all of the lines following the line `prefixes = []`.
