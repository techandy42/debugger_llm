    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in

    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
Bugs found:

1. "result = [1, 3, 2]": The initial list is incorrect. It should start with [1, 3].

2. "result.append(1 + i // 2)": For even numbers, it should be i / 2 + 1, not 1 + i // 2.

3. "result.append(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i + 1])": For odd numbers, it's trying to access result[i + 1] which doesn't exist yet. It should use (i + 3) / 2 instead.

To fix:
1. Initialize with [1, 3].
2. Use i / 2 + 1 for even numbers.
3. Replace result[i + 1] with (i + 3) / 2 for odd numbers.

These changes will make the implementation correct.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. `result = [1, 3, 2]`: This initialization is incorrect. It should be `[1, 3]`.

2. `result.append(1 + i // 2)`: This uses integer division instead of float division.

3. `result.append(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i + 1])`: This attempts to access `result[i + 1]` which doesn't exist yet.

To fix:
1. Initialize with `result = [1, 3]`.
2. Use `i / 2` instead of `i // 2`.
3. Replace `result[i + 1]` with `(i + 3) / 2`.

These changes will make the implementation correct and match the expected behavior of the Tribonacci sequence.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. "result = [1, 3, 2]": This initialization is incorrect. It should start with [1, 3].

2. "result.append(1 + i // 2)": The calculation for even numbers is wrong. It should be i / 2 + 1.

3. "result.append(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i + 1])": For odd numbers, it's trying to access result[i + 1], which doesn't exist yet.

To fix:
1. Initialize result as [1, 3].
2. For even numbers, use i / 2 + 1.
3. For odd numbers, use (i + 3) / 2 instead of result[i + 1].

These changes will align the implementation with the correct sequence definition.
