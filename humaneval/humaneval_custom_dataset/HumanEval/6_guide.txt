BUGGY SOLUTION:
from typing import List

    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.

       result = []

            for char in group:

                    depth -= 1
            result.append(max_depth)
        return result

ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
There are two bugs in the buggy code:

1. `"result = []"` and `"for group in paren_string.split():"` are indented incorrectly. They should be at the same level as the function definition.

2. `"result.append(max_depth)"` is inside the inner loop. It should be outside the inner loop but inside the outer loop.

To fix these issues:
1. Remove the indentation for the first two lines of the function body.
2. Move the result.append(max_depth) line to be aligned with the for char in group loop.

These changes will make the function behave correctly, matching the expected output.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains the following issue:

"       result = []
        for group in paren_string.split():
            depth = 0
            max_depth = 0
            for char in group:
                if char == '(':
                    depth += 1
                    max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)
                elif char == ')':
                    depth -= 1
            result.append(max_depth)
        return result"

The indentation is incorrect. The entire function body should be indented one level. To fix this, move the entire code block four spaces to the right, aligning it with the function definition.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code contains the following issues:

1. "result = []" and the subsequent lines are indented incorrectly. They should be at the same level as the function definition.

To fix this, align these lines with the function definition:

```python
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for group in paren_string.split():
        # ... rest of the code ...
```

This aligns with the correct implementation and ensures proper function structure.
