TASK ID: HumanEval/65

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue.

1. Incorrect Comparison Operator
- The comment in the function definition states that the digits are reversed if shift > number of digits.
- However, in the buggy code, the line `if shift >= length:` incorrectly uses >= operator instead of >.
- To fix this, replace >= with > operator in line `if shift >= length:` (i.e. `if shift > length:`).
