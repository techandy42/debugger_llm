ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `"sum(num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 != 0)"`: This line is missing the `return` statement.

2. The entire function body is not enclosed in parentheses, which is required for generator expressions used as function arguments.

To fix these issues:
1. Add `return` at the beginning of the line.
2. Enclose the generator expression in parentheses.

The corrected code should be:
`return sum((num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 != 0))`

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. "sum(num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 != 0)"
The function is missing a return statement. To fix this, add "return" at the beginning of the line.

2. "sum(num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 != 0)"
The generator expression is not enclosed in square brackets. To fix this, wrap the entire expression in square brackets.

Corrected code:
return sum([num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 != 0])

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `sum(num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 != 0)`
   The function is missing a `return` statement. To fix this, add `return` at the beginning of the line.

2. `sum(num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 != 0)`
   The generator expression is not enclosed in square brackets. To fix this, wrap the entire expression in square brackets.

The corrected code should look like:
`return sum([num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 != 0])`
