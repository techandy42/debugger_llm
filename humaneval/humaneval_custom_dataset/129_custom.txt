TASK ID: HumanEval/129

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Non-Code Comment in Code:
- The comment `Here's the implementation for the `minPath` function based on the provided docstring:` does not have a comment symbol in front of it, which causes runtime error.
- To fix this, remove the comment entirely, or add a comment symbol `#` in front of it.

2. Incorrect Indentation:
- All of the lines following the non-code comment have an additional level of identation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of indentation from all of the valid-code lines.
