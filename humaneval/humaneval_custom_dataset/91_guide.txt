GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:

ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `re` module is not imported:
   Add `import re` at the beginning of the function.

2. `re.split('[.?!]', S)` doesn't account for possible spaces after delimiters:
   Change it to `re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)` to handle potential spaces after delimiters.

These changes will make the function work correctly for all cases, including sentences with spaces after delimiters.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `"re.split('[.?!]', S)"`: This doesn't account for possible spaces after punctuation marks. It should be `re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)` to handle potential spaces.

2. `"import re"` is missing at the beginning of the function. The `re` module needs to be imported to use `re.split()`.

To fix these issues, add the import statement and modify the split pattern to match the correct implementation.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
There are two bugs in the buggy code:

1. `re` is not imported. Add `import re` at the beginning of the function.

2. In `re.split('[.?!]', S)`, the spaces after punctuation are not considered. Change it to `re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)` to handle potential spaces after punctuation marks.

These changes will make the function work correctly for all input cases.
