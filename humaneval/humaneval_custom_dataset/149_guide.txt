    Here's the implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function based on the provided docstring:
    
        return sorted([word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0], key=lambda x: (len(x), x))

ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
The buggy code contains one issue:

"Here's the implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function based on the provided docstring:"

This line should be removed as it's not part of the function implementation.

To fix this, simply remove the explanatory text and keep only the return statement:

return sorted([word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0], key=lambda x: (len(x), x))

This implementation correctly filters out odd-length strings, sorts by length and then alphabetically.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains one issue:

"`Here's the implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function based on the provided docstring:`"

This line should be removed as it's not part of the function implementation.

To fix this, simply remove the line and keep only the return statement. The correct implementation should be:

```python
return sorted([word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0], key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
```

This implementation correctly filters out odd-length strings, sorts the remaining strings by length and then alphabetically.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. "Here's the implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function based on the provided docstring:" 
This line should be removed as it's not part of the function implementation.

2. The entire function body is incorrect. It should be replaced with:

```python
lst.sort()
new_lst = []
for i in lst:
    if len(i)%2 == 0:
        new_lst.append(i)
return sorted(new_lst, key=len)
```

This implementation first sorts the list alphabetically, then filters out odd-length strings, and finally sorts the resulting list by length.
