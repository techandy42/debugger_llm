ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
The buggy code contains one issue:

`return sum(math.ceil(num) ** 2 for num in lst)`

The `math` module is not imported. To fix this, add `import math` at the beginning of the function:

```python
import math
return sum(math.ceil(num) ** 2 for num in lst)
```

This will allow the use of the `math.ceil()` function.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains one issue:

`math.ceil(num)` is used without importing the math module. To fix this, add `import math` at the beginning of the function.

Corrected code:
```python
import math
return sum(math.ceil(num) ** 2 for num in lst)
```

This modification will make the function work as intended, rounding each number to the ceiling before squaring and summing.
