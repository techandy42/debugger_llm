TASK ID: HumanEval/125

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Incorrect Conditional Check
- In the buggy code, the if statements use `not words` to check if the split result is empty.
- However, if there was no split, there will be one word in the resulting list.
- Thus, the condition will never catch cases where there is no space or comma in the string.
- To fix this, use a different conditional check such as `len(words) <= 1`.

2. Incorrect Use of Method
- In line `return sum(1 for char in txt.lower() if char.isalpha() and (ord(char) - ord('a')) % 2 == 1)` (e.g. count number of lower-case odd order letters), there is a logical mistake.
- `txt.lower()` converts all letters into lowercase, which falsely counts uppercase letters as well.
- To fix this, remove the `.lower()` part, and add an additional check `char.islower()` to only count lowercase letters.

After all of the changes take place, the code should look like:
```python
def split_words(txt):
    words = txt.split()
    if len(words) <= 1:
        words = txt.split(',')
    if len(words) <= 1:
        return sum(1 for char in txt if char.isalpha() and char.islower() and (ord(char) - ord('a')) % 2 == 1)
    return words
```
