ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. "factors = []" is not properly indented. It should be aligned with the function body.

2. The condition in the while loop should be "i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)" instead of "i * i <= n" for more precise handling of large numbers.

3. The import statement for the math module is missing.

4. The logic for appending factors is incorrect. It should append the factor and continue dividing by the same factor until it's no longer divisible.

To fix these issues:
1. Correct the indentation of "factors = []".
2. Change the while loop condition and import the math module.
3. Modify the logic inside the loop to continuously divide by the same factor when possible.

These changes will align the implementation with the correct functionality of the factorize function.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
Bugs found in the buggy code:

1. "factors = []" and the following lines are indented incorrectly.

2. The condition "if n % i:" should be "if n % i == 0:".

To fix these issues:

1. Remove the indentation for all lines after "factors = []".

2. Change "if n % i:" to "if n % i == 0:". This ensures factors are added when n is divisible by i.

These changes will make the function work correctly, matching the behavior of the correct implementation.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code contains the following issues:

1. Indentation error: The lines starting from `i = 2` are incorrectly indented. They should be aligned with the `factors = []` line.

2. `"if n % i:"` should be `"if n % i == 0:"` to correctly identify factors.

To fix these issues:
1. Correct the indentation of all lines after `factors = []`.
2. Change `if n % i:` to `if n % i == 0:`.
3. Swap the positions of `n //= i` and `factors.append(i)` to ensure factors are added in the correct order.

These changes will make the function work as intended, matching the behavior of the correct implementation.
