ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
The buggy code contains no actual bugs. It correctly implements the function to count even and odd digits in a given integer. The approach differs from the ground truth code but produces the same correct results. Both implementations handle negative numbers by using abs(), correctly count even and odd digits, and return the counts as a tuple.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains no actual bugs. It correctly handles negative numbers by using `abs(num)`, properly counts even and odd digits, and returns the correct tuple. The implementation differs from the ground truth code but achieves the same result. Both approaches are valid and produce correct outputs for the given function description.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code has one issue:

"num = abs(num)"

This line is correct but unnecessary. The function should work with negative numbers as well. To fix this, simply remove this line and process the number as is.

The rest of the implementation is correct and will produce the same results as the reference implementation, just using a different approach (modulo arithmetic instead of string conversion).
