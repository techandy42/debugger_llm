ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
The buggy code contains one main issue:

"`sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(x)))`"

This part doesn't handle negative numbers correctly. It uses `abs(x)`, which means the sum of digits for both positive and negative numbers will be the same.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Keep the sign of the number.
2. Only make the first digit negative for negative numbers.

The correct implementation uses a separate function `digits_sum` that handles this logic, ensuring negative numbers are processed correctly while maintaining their sign in the sum of digits.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains one issue:

"`sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(x)))`"

This part incorrectly calculates the sum of digits for negative numbers. It uses the absolute value of the number, which means -11 and 11 would have the same sum of digits.

To fix this, we need to handle negative numbers separately, keeping the first digit negative. We can use a helper function similar to the one in the correct implementation:

```python
def digits_sum(n):
    neg = 1
    if n < 0: n, neg = -1 * n, -1 
    n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    n[0] = n[0] * neg
    return sum(n)

return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (digits_sum(x), nums.index(x)))
```

This change ensures that negative numbers are handled correctly while maintaining the original order for numbers with the same digit sum.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `"sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(x)))"`: This doesn't handle negative numbers correctly. It should consider the sign of the first digit for negative numbers.

2. `"nums.index(x)"`: This unnecessarily uses the index as a secondary sorting key, which is not required according to the function description.

To fix these issues:
1. Implement a separate function to calculate the sum of digits, handling negative numbers correctly.
2. Remove the secondary sorting key based on the index.

The correct implementation should use a custom digit sum function as the sorting key, similar to the `digits_sum` function in the correct implementation.
