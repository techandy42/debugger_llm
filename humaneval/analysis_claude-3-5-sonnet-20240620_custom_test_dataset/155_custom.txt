TASK ID: HumanEval/155

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Unhandled Edge Case
- Since the while loop has condition `num > 0`, if num has value of 0, then the number of even/odd counts won't be computed.
- To fix this, add a condition to check if num is 0 and return (1, 0) before the while loop.
