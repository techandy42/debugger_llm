    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.

    return re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', s)

ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
The buggy code contains the following issue:

`return re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', s)`

This line uses the `re` module, which is not imported, and a regex pattern that doesn't handle commas correctly. It will fail to split words separated by commas and may include punctuation in the words.

To fix this, replace the entire function body with a solution that handles both space and comma separators. First, replace commas with spaces, then use the `split()` method to separate words. This approach correctly handles both space and comma-separated words without relying on regex.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains the following issue:

`return re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', s)`

This line uses the `re` module, which is not imported. Additionally, this approach doesn't handle commas correctly and may not split words properly in all cases.

To fix this, replace the entire function body with a solution that handles both spaces and commas. First, replace commas with spaces, then use the `split()` method to separate words. This approach ensures correct handling of both comma and space separators, as shown in the correct implementation.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code contains the following issue:

`return re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', s)`

This line uses the `re` module, which is not imported. Additionally, this approach doesn't correctly handle commas as separators.

To fix this, replace the entire function body with a solution that splits the string based on both spaces and commas. First, replace commas with spaces, then use the `split()` method to create the list of words. Also, add a check for an empty string at the beginning of the function to return an empty list in that case.
