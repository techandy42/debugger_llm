1. Incorrect Conditional Check
- In the buggy code, the if statements use `not words` to check if the split result is empty.
- However, if there was no split, there will be one word in the resulting list.
- Thus, the condition will never catch cases where there is no space or comma in the string.
- To fix this, use a different conditional check such as `len(words) <= 1`.

2. Incorrect Use of Method
- In line `return sum(1 for char in txt.lower() if char.isalpha() and (ord(char) - ord('a')) % 2 == 1)` (e.g. count number of lower-case odd order letters), there is a logical mistake.
- `txt.lower()` converts all letters into lowercase, which falsely counts uppercase letters as well.

To fix these issues:
1. Implement a separate function to calculate the sum of digits, handling negative numbers correctly.
