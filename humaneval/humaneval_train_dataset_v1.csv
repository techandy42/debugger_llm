Issues and fixes:

1. The condition `result != 1` is incorrect for determining if all digits are even. It fails for numbers with only one odd digit, like 1 or 5. Instead, use a separate counter for odd digits. Initialize `odd_count = 0` at the beginning, increment it when an odd digit is found, and return 0 if `odd_count == 0` at the end.

2. The while loop `while n > 0` processes digits from right to left, which may cause issues with leading zeros. Use `for digit in str(n):` to iterate through digits as strings, then convert each to an integer for processing.","The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Conditional statement:

1. Incorrect Logic
- The buggy code is computing the operators sequentially without accounting for order of operation.
- To fix this, instead of computing each operators and corresponding operands, the operators and operands can be combined as a string to form a expression, and use the built-in `eval` function to compute the expression. The following is an example of the correct implementation:
```python
expression = str(operand[0])
for oprt, oprn in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
    expression += oprt + str(oprn)

Note, the use of built-in `eval` function can pose security risks, use if only necessary, and make sure to sanitize the inputs to prevent injection attacks if needed (don't worry about it for this particular example).",7/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,5/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,4/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,4/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,7/7,4/7
