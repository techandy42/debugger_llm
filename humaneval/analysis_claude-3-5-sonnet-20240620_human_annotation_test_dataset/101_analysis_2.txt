GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:

    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Omitted Import Statement
- The code uses the `re` package, which is not imported.
- To fix this, add `import re` before the function body (e.g. `return re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', s)`).
