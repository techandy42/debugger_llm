CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Identation Issue:
- The code is indented incorrectly.
- The lines following the line `factors = []` has an additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of indentation from those lines.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains the following issues:

1. Indentation error: The lines starting from `i = 2` are incorrectly indented. They should be aligned with the `factors = []` line.

2. `"if n % i:"` should be `"if n % i == 0:"` to correctly identify factors.

To fix these issues:
1. Correct the indentation of all lines after `factors = []`.
2. Change `if n % i:` to `if n % i == 0:`.
3. Swap the positions of `n //= i` and `factors.append(i)` to ensure factors are added in the correct order.

These changes will make the function work as intended, matching the behavior of the correct implementation.
