CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Identation Issue:
- The code is indented incorrectly.
- The lines following the line `factors = []` has an additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of indentation from those lines.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
Bugs found in the buggy code:

1. "factors = []" and the following lines are indented incorrectly.

2. The condition "if n % i:" should be "if n % i == 0:".

To fix these issues:

1. Remove the indentation for all lines after "factors = []".

2. Change "if n % i:" to "if n % i == 0:". This ensures factors are added when n is divisible by i.

These changes will make the function work correctly, matching the behavior of the correct implementation.
