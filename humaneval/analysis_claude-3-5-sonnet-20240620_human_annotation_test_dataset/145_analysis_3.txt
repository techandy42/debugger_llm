    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(x))), nums.index(x)))

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Mishandled Edge Case
- The buggy code does not account for negative numbers, where the first digit following a negative sign should be treated as a negative number (e.g. "-11" -> -1 + 1 -> 0)
- To fix this, extend the code to handle cases where the number is negative, and if so, and multiply the first digit by -1.
- A potential solution could look like:
```python
def order_by_points(nums):
def digits_sum(n):
neg = 1
if n < 0: n, neg = -1 * n, -1
n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
n[0] = n[0] * neg
return sum(n)
return sorted(nums, key=digits_sum)
```

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one main issue:

"`sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(x)))`"

This part doesn't handle negative numbers correctly. It uses `abs(x)`, which means the sum of digits for both positive and negative numbers will be the same.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Keep the sign of the number.
2. Only make the first digit negative for negative numbers.

The correct implementation uses a separate function `digits_sum` that handles this logic, ensuring negative numbers are processed correctly while maintaining their sign in the sum of digits.
