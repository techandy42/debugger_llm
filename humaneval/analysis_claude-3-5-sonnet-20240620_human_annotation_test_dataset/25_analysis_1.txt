CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Identation Issue:
- The code is indented incorrectly.
- The lines following the line `factors = []` has an additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of indentation from those lines.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. "factors = []" is not properly indented. It should be aligned with the function body.

2. The condition in the while loop should be "i <= int(math.sqrt(n) + 1)" instead of "i * i <= n" for more precise handling of large numbers.

3. The import statement for the math module is missing.

4. The logic for appending factors is incorrect. It should append the factor and continue dividing by the same factor until it's no longer divisible.

To fix these issues:
1. Correct the indentation of "factors = []".
2. Change the while loop condition and import the math module.
3. Modify the logic inside the loop to continuously divide by the same factor when possible.

These changes will align the implementation with the correct functionality of the factorize function.
