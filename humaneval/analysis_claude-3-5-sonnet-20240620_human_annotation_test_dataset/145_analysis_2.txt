GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:

    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers

    For example:

    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(x))), nums.index(x)))

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Mishandled Edge Case
- The buggy code does not account for negative numbers, where the first digit following a negative sign should be treated as a negative number (e.g. "-11" -> -1 + 1 -> 0)
- To fix this, extend the code to handle cases where the number is negative, and if so, and multiply the first digit by -1.
- A potential solution could look like:
```python
def order_by_points(nums):
def digits_sum(n):
neg = 1
if n < 0: n, neg = -1 * n, -1
n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
n[0] = n[0] * neg
return sum(n)
return sorted(nums, key=digits_sum)
```

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `"sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(x)))"`: This doesn't handle negative numbers correctly. It should consider the sign of the first digit for negative numbers.

2. `"nums.index(x)"`: This unnecessarily uses the index as a secondary sorting key, which is not required according to the function description.

To fix these issues:
1. Implement a separate function to calculate the sum of digits, handling negative numbers correctly.
2. Remove the secondary sorting key based on the index.

The correct implementation should use a custom digit sum function as the sorting key, similar to the `digits_sum` function in the correct implementation.
