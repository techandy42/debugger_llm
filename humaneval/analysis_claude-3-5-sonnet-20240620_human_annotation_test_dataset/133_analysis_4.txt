CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Omitted Import Statement
- The code uses the `math` package, which is not imported.
- To fix this, add `import math` before the function body (e.g. `return sum(math.ceil(num) ** 2 for num in lst)`).

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

`return sum(math.ceil(num) ** 2 for num in lst)`

The `math` module is not imported. To fix this, add `import math` at the beginning of the function:

```python
import math
return sum(math.ceil(num) ** 2 for num in lst)
```

This will allow the use of the `math.ceil()` function.
