CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Mishandled Edge Case
- The buggy code does not account for negative numbers, where the first digit following a negative sign should be treated as a negative number (e.g. "-11" -> -1 + 1 -> 0)
- To fix this, extend the code to handle cases where the number is negative, and if so, and multiply the first digit by -1.
- A potential solution could look like:
```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    def digits_sum(n):
        neg = 1
        if n < 0: n, neg = -1 * n, -1 
        n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
        n[0] = n[0] * neg
        return sum(n)
    return sorted(nums, key=digits_sum)
```

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

"`sum(int(d) for d in str(abs(x)))`"

This part incorrectly calculates the sum of digits for negative numbers. It uses the absolute value of the number, which means -11 and 11 would have the same sum of digits.

To fix this, we need to handle negative numbers separately, keeping the first digit negative. We can use a helper function similar to the one in the correct implementation:

```python
def digits_sum(n):
    neg = 1
    if n < 0: n, neg = -1 * n, -1 
    n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    n[0] = n[0] * neg
    return sum(n)

return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (digits_sum(x), nums.index(x)))
```

This change ensures that negative numbers are handled correctly while maintaining the original order for numbers with the same digit sum.
