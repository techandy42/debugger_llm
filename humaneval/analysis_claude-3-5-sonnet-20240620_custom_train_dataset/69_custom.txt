TASK ID: HumanEval/69

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Missing Comment Symbol/Non-Code Text in Code:
- The comment `Here's the implementation of the `search` function based on the provided docstring:` is inside the function without the comment symbol.
- To fix this, remove the comment or add the comment symbol "#" at the beginning of the line.

2. Incorrect Indentation:
- The rest of the code has an additional level of indentation, which causes a indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of indentation from the code.
