TASK ID: HumanEval/151

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue.

1. Missing Return Statement:
- As outlined in the function description, the function should return the computed result.
- The buggy code is missing the return statement to return the result of the line `sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)`.
- To fix this, add a return statement to line `sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)`.
