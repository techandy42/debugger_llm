    return encoded

ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. `"new_char = chr((ord(char.lower()) - 97 + 2) % 26 + 97)"`:
   This calculation doesn't handle uppercase vowels correctly. It should use a dictionary for vowel replacement.

2. `"encoded += new_char.upper() if char.isupper() else new_char"`:
   This line maintains the original case for vowels, which is incorrect. All characters should have their case swapped.

To fix these issues:
1. Create a dictionary for vowel replacement.
2. Swap the case of all characters first.
3. Replace vowels using the dictionary.

The correct implementation would use `message.swapcase()` and a dictionary comprehension for vowel replacement, then apply the replacement in a list comprehension.

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `new_char = chr((ord(char.lower()) - 97 + 2) % 26 + 97)`
This formula doesn't correctly replace vowels with letters 2 places ahead. It should be replaced with a direct mapping using a dictionary.

2. `encoded += new_char.upper() if char.isupper() else new_char`
This line preserves the original case for vowels, which is incorrect. All characters should have their case swapped.

To fix these issues:
1. Create a vowel replacement dictionary.
2. Swap the case of the entire message at once.
3. Replace vowels using the dictionary, maintaining the swapped case.

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `"if char.lower() in vowels:"` - This part doesn't account for uppercase vowels correctly.

Fix: Create a vowel replacement dictionary as in the correct implementation.

2. `"encoded += char.lower() if char.isupper() else char.upper()"` - This swaps the case for all characters, including vowels that have already been replaced.

Fix: Swap the case of the entire message at once using the swapcase() method before processing vowels.

To correct these issues, implement the vowel replacement dictionary and apply swapcase() to the entire message first, then replace vowels as needed.
