TASK ID: HumanEval/160

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The bug code contains one issue.

1. Incorrect Logic
- The buggy code is computing the operators sequentially without accounting for order of operation.
- To fix this, instead of computing each operators and corresponding operands, the operators and operands can be combined as a string to form a expression, and use the built-in `eval` function to compute the expression. The following is an example of the correct implementation:
```python
expression = str(operand[0])
for oprt, oprn in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
    expression += oprt + str(oprn)
return eval(expression)
```

Note, the use of built-in `eval` function can pose security risks, use if only necessary, and make sure to sanitize the inputs to prevent injection attacks if needed (don't worry about it for this particular example).
