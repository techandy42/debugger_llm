TASK ID: HumanEval/79

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Unnecessary Code:
- The line `padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)` pads the binary with zeroes to ensure at least 8 bits, which is unnecessary operation that causes the output to be different than what was specified in the function description.
- To fix this, remove the line `padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)` and modify last line to `return "db" + binary + "db"`.
