TASK ID: HumanEval/116

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Non-Code Comment in Code:
- The comment `Here's the implementation of the `sort_array` function based on the provided docstring:` does not have a comment symbol in front of it, which causes runtime error.
- To fix this, remove the comment entirely, or add a comment symbol `#` in front of it.

2. Incorrect Indentation:
- The line `return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(abs(x)).count('1'), x))` contains an additional level of indentation compared to the comments in the function description, which causes a indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of Indentation from the line so it aligns with the comments in the function description.
