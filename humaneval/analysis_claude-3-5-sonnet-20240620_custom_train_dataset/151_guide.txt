    sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)

ANALYSIS ROUND 1:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. `sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)`

Issues and fixes:
1. The function is missing a `return` statement. Add `return` at the beginning of the line.
2. `isinstance(num, int)` doesn't exclude float values. Replace it with `"." not in str(num)` to properly exclude non-integer values.

Corrected implementation:
```python
return sum(num**2 for num in lst if "." not in str(num) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)
```

ANALYSIS ROUND 2:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. `sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)`

Issues and fixes:
1. The function lacks a return statement. Add `return` before the sum calculation.
2. `isinstance(num, int)` doesn't exclude float integers. Replace it with `"." not in str(num)` to properly exclude non-integer numbers.

Corrected code:
```python
return sum(num**2 for num in lst if "." not in str(num) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)
```

ANALYSIS ROUND 3:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)`
   This line is missing a `return` statement. To fix, add `return` at the beginning.

2. `isinstance(num, int)`
   This check doesn't exclude floating-point numbers that are effectively integers. Replace it with `"." not in str(num)` to properly exclude non-integer numbers.
