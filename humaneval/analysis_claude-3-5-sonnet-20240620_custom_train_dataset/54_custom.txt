TASK ID: HumanEval/54

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Missing Return Statement:
- As outlined in the function description, the function should return the computed boolean value.
- The buggy code is missing the return statement to return the result of the line `set(s0) == set(s1)`.
- To fix this, add a return statement to line `set(s0) == set(s1)`.
