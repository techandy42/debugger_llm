    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:

BUGGY SOLUTION:
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..


    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 
    """
    sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Missing Return Statement:
- As outlined in the function description, the function should return the computed result.
- The buggy code is missing the return statement to return the result of the line `sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)`.
- To fix this, add a return statement to line `sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

"`sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)`"

The problem is that the function doesn't return the result of the sum. To fix this, add a `return` statement before the sum operation:

```python
return sum(lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0)
```

This will ensure the function returns the sum of even elements at odd indices as intended.
