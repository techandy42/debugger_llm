    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // )

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The bug code contains one issue.

1. Incorrect Logic
- The buggy code is computing the operators sequentially without accounting for order of operation.
- To fix this, instead of computing each operators and corresponding operands, the operators and operands can be combined as a string to form a expression, and use the built-in `eval` function to compute the expression. The following is an example of the correct implementation:
```python
expression = str(operand[0])
for oprt, oprn in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
expression+= oprt + str(oprn)
return eval(expression)
```

Note, the use of built-in `eval` function can pose security risks, use if only necessary, and make sure to sanitize the inputs to prevent injection attacks if needed (don't worry about it for this particular example).

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code has one main issue:

"`result = operand[0]`" and the subsequent arithmetic operations don't consider operator precedence. This leads to incorrect results when the expression involves operators with different precedence levels.

To fix this, we should build a string expression and use `eval()` to evaluate it, respecting operator precedence:

```python
expression = str(operand[0])
for oprt, oprn in zip(operator, operand[1:]):
    expression += oprt + str(oprn)
return eval(expression)
```

This approach ensures correct evaluation of the algebraic expression, considering all operator precedences.
