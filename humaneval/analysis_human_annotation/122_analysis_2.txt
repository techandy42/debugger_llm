CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Assumption:
- The line `if 1 <= arr[i] <= 99:` only accounts for positive integers with two or less digits.
- The code should account for inputs that are negative as well.
- To fix this, wrap `arr[i]` with `abs` function to check if the integer has two or less digits, regardless of whether it's positive or not.

Furthermore, given the constraints in the function description, the `min(k, len(arr))` is line `for i in range(min(k, len(arr)))` is unnecessary and can be replaced with `k`. However, this does not cause runtime issue.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. `if 1 <= arr[i] <= 99:`

This condition is incorrect as it doesn't include single-digit numbers (0-9) and excludes negative two-digit numbers.

Fix: Change the condition to `if len(str(abs(arr[i]))) <= 2:` to include all numbers with at most two digits, including negatives.

2. `for i in range(min(k, len(arr))):`

While this loop is not necessarily wrong, it's less efficient than slicing the array.

Fix: Replace the loop with a list comprehension and use array slicing: `return sum(elem for elem in arr[:k] if len(str(abs(elem))) <= 2)`
