TASK ID: HumanEval/86

GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.

    For example:
    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'
    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'
    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Unnecessary Separation Between Alphabet and Non-alphabet Characters:
- The buggy code separates alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters, which is not required in the function description, and will output incorrect answers.
- To fix this, remove all code that separates the alphabet characters from non-alphabet characters. The code within the line `for word in words:` should only contain the following, for example:
```python
ordered_words.append(''.join(sorted(word)))
```
