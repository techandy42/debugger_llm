GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
def sort_array(arr):
    """
    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to
    number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order.
    For similar number of ones, sort based on decimal value.

    It must be implemented like this:
    >>> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> sort_array([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]) == [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]

    Here's the implementation of the `sort_array` function based on the provided docstring:
    
        return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(abs(x)).count('1'), x))

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Non-Code Comment in Code:
- The comment `Here's the implementation of the `sort_array` function based on the provided docstring:` does not have a comment symbol in front of it, which causes runtime error.
- To fix this, remove the comment entirely, or add a comment symbol `#` in front of it.

2. Incorrect Indentation:
- The line `return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(abs(x)).count('1'), x))` contains an additional level of indentation compared to the comments in the function description, which causes a indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of identation from the line so it aligns with the comments in the function description.
