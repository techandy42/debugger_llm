CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The lines following the line `letter_grades = []` has an additional level of identation which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of indentation from all of the lines following the line "letter_grades = []".

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one indentation error:

"`
    letter_grades = []
        for gpa in grades:
"`

The `for` loop and its contents should be aligned with the `letter_grades` list initialization. To fix this, remove the extra indentation before the `for` loop and its contents, aligning them with the `letter_grades = []` line.
