CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Identation Issue:
- The lines following the line `vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')` has an unnecessary additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of indentation from the lines following the line `vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')` is not indented correctly. It should be inside the function.

2. The condition `if len(word) < 3:` is missing at the beginning of the function.

To fix these issues:
1. Indent the vowels set definition.
2. Add the length check condition at the start of the function.

These changes will make the code functionally equivalent to the correct implementation.
