CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Identation Issue:
- The lines following the line `stack = []` has an additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of identation from all of the lines from the line `stack = []`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code has one issue:

`for bracket in brackets:` is indented incorrectly. It should be at the same level as `stack = []`.

To fix this, simply remove the extra indentation before the for loop. The correct implementation uses a depth counter instead of a stack, which is more efficient, but the stack-based approach is also valid if implemented correctly.
