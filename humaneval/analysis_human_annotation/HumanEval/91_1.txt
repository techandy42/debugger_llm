    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issues:

1. Missing Import Statement:
- The buggy code does not import the `re` module.
- To fix this, add `import re` at the beginning of the function.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `"re.split('[.?!]', S)"`: This doesn't account for possible spaces after punctuation marks. It should be `re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)` to handle potential spaces.

2. `"import re"` is missing at the beginning of the function. The `re` module needs to be imported to use `re.split()`.

To fix these issues, add the import statement and modify the split pattern to match the correct implementation.
