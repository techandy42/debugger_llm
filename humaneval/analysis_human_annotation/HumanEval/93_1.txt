    Assume only letters.

    for char in message:
        if char.lower() in vowels:

        else:
            encoded += char.lower() if char.isupper() else char.upper()
    return encoded

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Conditional:
- The line `encoded += new_char.upper() if char.isupper() else new_char` incorrectly uses `char.isupper()` in the conditional check.
- We instead want to check if the character is lowercase to correctly swap the case of the new character.
- To fix this, replace `char.isupper()` with `char.islower()` in the conditional check.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `"if char.lower() in vowels:"` - This part doesn't account for uppercase vowels correctly.

Fix: Create a vowel replacement dictionary as in the correct implementation.

2. `"encoded += char.lower() if char.isupper() else char.upper()"` - This swaps the case for all characters, including vowels that have already been replaced.

Fix: Swap the case of the entire message at once using the swapcase() method before processing vowels.

To correct these issues, implement the vowel replacement dictionary and apply swapcase() to the entire message first, then replace vowels as needed.
