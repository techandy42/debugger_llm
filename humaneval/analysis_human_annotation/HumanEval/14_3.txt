TASK ID: HumanEval/14

GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    result = []

    for i in range(len(string)):
        result.append(string[:i+1])
    return result

BUGGY SOLUTION:
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []
        for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):
            prefixes.append(string[:i])
        return prefixes

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Identation Issue:
- The lines following the line `prefixes = []` have an additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of indentation from all of the lines following the line `prefixes = []`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
There are two bugs in the buggy code:

1. `prefixes = []` is not properly indented. It should be aligned with the function body.

2. The range in the for loop starts from 1 instead of 0: `for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)`.

To fix these issues:
1. Correct the indentation of `prefixes = []`.
2. Change the range to start from 0: `for i in range(len(string))`.
3. Adjust the slicing to `string[:i+1]` to include the correct prefix lengths.

These changes will make the function behave correctly, returning all prefixes from shortest to longest.
