TASK ID: HumanEval/14

GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    result = []

    for i in range(len(string)):
        result.append(string[:i+1])
    return result

BUGGY SOLUTION:
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []
        for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):
            prefixes.append(string[:i])
        return prefixes

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Identation Issue:
- The lines following the line `prefixes = []` have an additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of indentation from all of the lines following the line `prefixes = []`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `prefixes = []`: This line is not indented correctly. It should be aligned with the function body.

2. `for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):`: The range should start from 0 instead of 1 to include all prefixes.

To fix these issues:
1. Remove the indentation before `prefixes = []`.
2. Change the range to `range(len(string))` and use `string[:i+1]` in the append statement.

These changes will ensure all prefixes are included, starting from the shortest to the longest.
