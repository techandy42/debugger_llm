CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The lines following the line `if n < 2:` contains an additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of indentation from all of the lines following the line `if n < 2:`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains no actual bugs. It's an alternative, more efficient implementation of the fibfib function using iteration instead of recursion. This approach avoids redundant calculations and has better time complexity for larger values of n.

The only minor issue is the indentation of the first three lines inside the function, which should be aligned with the rest of the code:

```python
if n < 2:
    return 0
elif n == 2:
    return 1
```

This indentation issue doesn't affect the functionality but should be corrected for proper Python syntax.
