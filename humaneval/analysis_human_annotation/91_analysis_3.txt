GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issues:

1. Missing Import Statement:
- The buggy code does not import the `re` module.
- To fix this, add `import re` at the beginning of the function.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
There are two bugs in the buggy code:

1. `re` is not imported. Add `import re` at the beginning of the function.

2. In `re.split('[.?!]', S)`, the spaces after punctuation are not considered. Change it to `re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)` to handle potential spaces after punctuation marks.

These changes will make the function work correctly for all input cases.
