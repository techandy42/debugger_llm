CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Missing Return Statement:
- As outlined in the function description, the function should return the computed boolean value.
- The buggy code is missing the return statement to return the result of the line `set(s0) == set(s1)`.
- To fix this, add a return statement to line `set(s0) == set(s1)`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

`set(s0) == set(s1)`

This line compares the sets of characters from both strings but doesn't return the result. To fix this, add a return statement:

return set(s0) == set(s1)

This will correctly return True if both strings contain the same characters, and False otherwise.
