TASK ID: HumanEval/14

GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    result = []

    for i in range(len(string)):
        result.append(string[:i+1])
    return result

BUGGY SOLUTION:
from typing import List


def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []
        for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):
            prefixes.append(string[:i])
        return prefixes

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The lines following the line `prefixes = []` have an additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of indentation from all of the lines following the line `prefixes = []`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
There are two bugs in the buggy code:

1. `for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):`: This range starts from 1 instead of 0, causing the first prefix (single character) to be missed. To fix this, change it to `range(len(string))`.

2. Indentation error: The entire for loop and return statement are incorrectly indented. They should be aligned with the `prefixes = []` line.

To fix these issues, adjust the range and correct the indentation as shown in the correct implementation.
