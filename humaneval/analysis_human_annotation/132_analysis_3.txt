        return nested

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The lines following the line `stack = []` have an addition level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of Indentation from all of the lines following the line `stack = []`.

2. Logic Error:
- The buggy code checks if there is equal or more number of opening brackets than closing brackets in a series of nested brackets, without checking if the nested brackets close properly.
- For example, the buggy code will return True for the input `[[]` which is incorrect.
- To fix this, keep track of the current level of nesting, and if the series of brackets up to the current point fully closes, update the maximum level of nesting and reset the current level of nesting. Return True if the maximum level of nesting is two or more. The following is an example of the correct implementation:
```python
stack = []
max_nesting_level = 0
cur_nesting_level = 0
for bracket in string:
if bracket == '[':
stack.append(bracket)
elif bracket == ']' and stack:
if stack:
cur_nesting_level += 1
stack.pop()
if not stack:
max_nesting_level = max(max_nesting_level, cur_nesting_level)
cur_nesting_level = 0
return max_nesting_level >= 2
```

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains the following issues:

1. Indentation error: The lines starting from "nested = False" are incorrectly indented. They should be aligned with the "stack = []" line.

2. Logic error: The function only checks for immediate nesting and doesn't account for all valid subsequences. This approach will fail for cases like '[[][]]'.

To fix these issues:

1. Correct the indentation of the code.

2. Implement the logic using separate lists for opening and closing bracket indices, then compare them to determine if there are at least two nested brackets. This approach will correctly handle all valid subsequences of nested brackets.

The correct implementation should track the indices of opening and closing brackets, reverse the closing bracket indices, and then count the number of valid nested pairs.
