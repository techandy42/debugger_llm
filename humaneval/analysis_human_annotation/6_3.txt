CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Identation Issue:
- The code is indented incorrectly.
- Specifically, the line `result = []` uses three spaces for identation, while the rest of the code uses four spaces.
- Additionally, the code has an additional identation level that is not necessary.
- To fix this, remove the three spaces of identation from the line `result = []` and four spaces of identation from the rest of the code so they align with the comments in the function.
