        return nested

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The lines following the line `stack = []` have an addition level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of Indentation from all of the lines following the line `stack = []`.

2. Logic Error:
- The buggy code checks if there is equal or more number of opening brackets than closing brackets in a series of nested brackets, without checking if the nested brackets close properly.
- For example, the buggy code will return True for the input `[[]` which is incorrect.
- To fix this, keep track of the current level of nesting, and if the series of brackets up to the current point fully closes, update the maximum level of nesting and reset the current level of nesting. Return True if the maximum level of nesting is two or more. The following is an example of the correct implementation:
```python
stack = []
max_nesting_level = 0
cur_nesting_level = 0
for bracket in string:
if bracket == '[':
stack.append(bracket)
elif bracket == ']' and stack:
if stack:
cur_nesting_level += 1
stack.pop()
if not stack:
max_nesting_level = max(max_nesting_level, cur_nesting_level)
cur_nesting_level = 0
return max_nesting_level >= 2
```

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains the following issues:

1. `"stack = []"` and `"nested = False"` are indented incorrectly. They should be at the same indentation level as the rest of the function body.

2. The logic for determining nesting is incorrect. It only checks if there's a closing bracket when the stack is not empty, which doesn't accurately represent nesting.

To fix these issues:

1. Remove the indentation for the first two lines inside the function.

2. Replace the entire function body with the correct implementation that uses separate lists for opening and closing bracket indices, reverses the closing bracket indices, and counts the number of valid nested pairs.

The correct implementation should track the indices of opening and closing brackets separately, reverse the closing bracket indices, and then count the number of valid nested pairs. It should return True if there are at least two nested pairs.
