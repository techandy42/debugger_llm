CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Operator:
- The comment in the function definition states that the digits are reversed if shift > number of digits.
- However, in the buggy code, the line `if shift >= length:` incorrectly uses >= operator instead of >.
- To fix this, replace >= with > operator in line `if shift >= length:`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

`if shift >= length:`

This condition should be `if shift > length:`. The current implementation will reverse the digits even when the shift is equal to the length of the number, which is incorrect. To fix this, change the condition to strictly greater than, as in the correct implementation.
