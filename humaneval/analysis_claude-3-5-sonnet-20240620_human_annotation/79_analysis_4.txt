TASK ID: HumanEval/79

GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"

BUGGY SOLUTION:

    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove '0b' prefix
    padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)  # Pad with zeros to ensure at least 8 bits
    return "db" + padded_binary + "db"

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Unnecessary Code:
- The line `padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)` pads the binary with zeroes to ensure at least 8 bits, which is unnecessary operation that causes the output to be different than what was specified in the function description.
- To fix this, remove the line `padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)` and modify last line to `return "db" + binary + "db"`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

"`padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)`"

This line unnecessarily pads the binary representation to 8 bits. The correct implementation should not pad the binary number to a fixed length. To fix this, simply remove the padding line and return the binary representation directly:

return "db" + binary + "db"

This change will ensure the function returns the correct binary representation for any decimal input, without unnecessary padding.
