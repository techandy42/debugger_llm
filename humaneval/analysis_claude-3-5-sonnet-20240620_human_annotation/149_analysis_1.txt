    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,

    and it may contain duplicates.
    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
    should return the list sorted by that rule.
    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.
    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
    You may assume that all words will have the same length.
    For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]

    Here's the implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function based on the provided docstring:
    
        return sorted([word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0], key=lambda x: (len(x), x))

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Non-Code Comment in Code:
- The comment `Here's the implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function based on the provided docstring:` does not have a comment symbol in front of it, which causes runtime error.
- To fix this, remove the comment entirely, or add a comment symbol `#` in front of it.

2. Incorrect Indentation:
- The line `return sorted([word for word in lst if len(word) % 2 == 0], key=lambda x: (len(x), x))` contains an additional level of indentation compared to the comments in the function description, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of indentation from the line.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. "Here's the implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function based on the provided docstring:" 
This line should be removed as it's not part of the function implementation.

2. The entire function body is incorrect. It should be replaced with:

```python
lst.sort()
new_lst = []
for i in lst:
    if len(i)%2 == 0:
        new_lst.append(i)
return sorted(new_lst, key=len)
```

This implementation first sorts the list alphabetically, then filters out odd-length strings, and finally sorts the resulting list by length.
