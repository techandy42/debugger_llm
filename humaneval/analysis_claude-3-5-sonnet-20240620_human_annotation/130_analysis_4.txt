    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in

    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

    return result

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Index Error
- The `result[i + 1]` code snippet in line `result.append(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i + 1])` causes an index error since i is pointing to the last index in the result.
- To fix this, replace `result[i + 1]` with `(i + 3) /2`, which properly adds the next value without causing the index error. After the change, the line should look like:
```python
result.append(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)
```

2. Edge Case for Variable Initializable Value
- The initial value for result is `[1, 3, 2]` in the buggy code, which returns `[1, 3, 2]` given n = 1, which is incorrect.
- To fix this, initialize the result list with `[1, 3]` instead of `[1, 3, 2]`, and replace `3` with `2` inside the line `for i in range(3, n + 1)`. After the changes, those two lines should look like:
```python
result = [1, 3]
for i in range(2, n + 1):
```

TARGET ANALYSIS:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. `result = [1, 3, 2]`: This initialization is incorrect. It should be `[1, 3]`.

2. `result.append(1 + i // 2)`: This uses integer division instead of float division.

3. `result.append(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i + 1])`: This attempts to access `result[i + 1]` which doesn't exist yet.

To fix:
1. Initialize with `result = [1, 3]`.
2. Use `i / 2` instead of `i // 2`.
3. Replace `result[i + 1]` with `(i + 3) / 2`.

These changes will make the implementation correct and match the expected behavior of the Tribonacci sequence.
