TASK ID: HumanEval/79

GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.
    The extra characters are there to help with the format.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"

BUGGY SOLUTION:

    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove '0b' prefix
    padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)  # Pad with zeros to ensure at least 8 bits
    return "db" + padded_binary + "db"

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Unnecessary Code:
- The line `padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)` pads the binary with zeroes to ensure at least 8 bits, which is unnecessary operation that causes the output to be different than what was specified in the function description.
- To fix this, remove the line `padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)` and modify last line to `return "db" + binary + "db"`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

`padded_binary = binary.zfill(8)`

This line pads the binary string to 8 bits, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the given function description. The function should return the binary representation without any fixed-length padding.

To fix this, simply remove the padding line and directly return the binary string with 'db' added at the beginning and end:

```python
return "db" + binary + "db"
```

This matches the correct implementation, which uses `bin(decimal)[2:]` to convert the decimal to binary and remove the '0b' prefix, then adds 'db' to both ends of the string.
