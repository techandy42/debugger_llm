CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The lines following the line `vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')` has an unnecessary additional level of indentation, which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove an additional level of indentation from the lines following the line `vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')`.
