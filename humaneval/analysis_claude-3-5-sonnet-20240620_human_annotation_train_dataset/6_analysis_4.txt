        return result

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The code is indented incorrectly.
- Specifically, the line `result = []` uses three spaces for Indentation, while the rest of the code uses four spaces.
- Additionally, the code has an additional Indentation level that is not necessary.
- To fix this, remove the three spaces of Indentation from the line `result = []` and four spaces of Indentation from the rest of the code so they align with the comments in the function.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
There are two bugs in the buggy code:

1. `"result = []"` and `"for group in paren_string.split():"` are indented incorrectly. They should be at the same level as the function definition.

2. `"result.append(max_depth)"` is inside the inner loop. It should be outside the inner loop but inside the outer loop.

To fix these issues:
1. Remove the indentation for the first two lines of the function body.
2. Move the result.append(max_depth) line to be aligned with the for char in group loop.

These changes will make the function behave correctly, matching the expected output.
