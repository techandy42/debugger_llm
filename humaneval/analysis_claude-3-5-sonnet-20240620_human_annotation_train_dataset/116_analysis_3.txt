    Here's the implementation of the `sort_array` function based on the provided docstring:
    
        return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(abs(x)).count('1'), x))

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Non-Code Comment in Code:
- The comment `Here's the implementation of the `sort_array` function based on the provided docstring:` does not have a comment symbol in front of it, which causes runtime error.
- To fix this, remove the comment entirely, or add a comment symbol `#` in front of it.

2. Incorrect Indentation:
- The line `return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(abs(x)).count('1'), x))` contains an additional level of indentation compared to the comments in the function description, which causes a indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of Indentation from the line so it aligns with the comments in the function description.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `"Here's the implementation of the `sort_array` function based on the provided docstring:"` should be removed as it's not part of the function implementation.

2. `"return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(abs(x)).count('1'), x))"` has two problems:
   a. It uses `abs(x)` which is unnecessary and incorrect for handling negative numbers.
   b. It doesn't perform a preliminary sort based on decimal value.

To fix these issues:
1. Remove the explanatory text.
2. Use `bin(x)[2:]` instead of `bin(abs(x))` to correctly handle negative numbers.
3. Apply a preliminary sort using `sorted(arr)` before the main sort.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
return sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
```

This ensures correct handling of negative numbers and proper sorting based on both binary ones count and decimal value.
