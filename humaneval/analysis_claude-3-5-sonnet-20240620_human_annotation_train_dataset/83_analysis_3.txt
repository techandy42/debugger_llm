    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.

BUGGY SOLUTION:
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    return 2 * 10**(n - 1) - 10**(n - 2)

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Formula:
- The formula `return 2 * 10**(n - 1) - 10**(n - 2)` incorrectly calculate the permutation.
- The formula incorrectly assumes that the total count of numbers that start or end with 1 can be caclulated by simply subtracting the overlap, without accounting for the permutation of digits in the middle of the number.
- Thus, the formula overcounts the permutation.
- To fix this, the formula should consider the permutations of the digits in the middle while limiting the choices for the first and last digits.
- Thus, replace line `return 2 * 10**(n - 1) - 10**(n - 2)` with the following code:
```python
if n == 1: return 1 # only number 1 satisfies the condition
return 18 * (10 ** (n - 2))
```

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `return 2 * 10**(n - 1) - 10**(n - 2)`
This formula is incorrect. It doesn't account for the special case when n = 1, and it overcounts numbers that start and end with 1.

To fix this, implement the correct logic:
- For n = 1, return 1
- For n > 1, return 18 * (10 ** (n - 2))

2. The function doesn't handle the case when n = 1 separately.

To fix this, add a condition to check if n = 1 before the main calculation.
