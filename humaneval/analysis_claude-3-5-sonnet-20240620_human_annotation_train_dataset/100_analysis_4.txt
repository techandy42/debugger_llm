GROUND TRUTH SOLUTION:
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Incorrect Logic:
- The buggy code is incrementing the number of stones by 1 for odd number of stones.
- However, in order to next the next odd/even number, the correct approach is to add 2 to the current number of stones regardless of odd/even.
- To fix this, replace the `if` and `else` statements under the `for _ in range(1, n):` line with `current += 2`. The for loop should now look like:
```python
for _ in range(1, n):
    current += 2
    pile.append(current)
```

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. `if current % 2 == 0:
            current += 2
        else:
            current += 1`

This logic is incorrect. It should always increment by 2, regardless of whether the current number is odd or even.

2. `pile = [n]
    current = n`

This initialization is unnecessary. The function can be simplified to use a list comprehension.

To fix these issues, replace the entire function body with:

`return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]`

This single line correctly generates the pile of stones for both odd and even numbers, always incrementing by 2 for each level.
