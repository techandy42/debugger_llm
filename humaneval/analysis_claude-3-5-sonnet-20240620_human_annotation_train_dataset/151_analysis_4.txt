BUGGY SOLUTION:
def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10

    '''
    sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue.

1. Missing Return Statement:
- As outlined in the function description, the function should return the computed result.
- The buggy code is missing the return statement to return the result of the line `sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)`.
- To fix this, add a return statement to line `sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)`.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
Bugs in the buggy code:

1. `sum(num**2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)`

Issues and fixes:
1. The function lacks a return statement. Add `return` before the sum calculation.
2. `isinstance(num, int)` doesn't exclude float integers. Replace it with `"." not in str(num)` to properly exclude non-integer numbers.

Corrected code:
```python
return sum(num**2 for num in lst if "." not in str(num) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0)
```
