CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one issue:

1. Indentation Issue:
- The lines following the line `letter_grades = []` has an additional level of Indentation which causes indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of indentation from all of the lines following the line "letter_grades = []".

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains one indentation error:

"`
    letter_grades = []
        for gpa in grades:
"`

The `for` loop and its contents should be at the same indentation level as the `letter_grades = []` line. To fix this, simply remove the extra indentation before the `for` loop and its contents.
