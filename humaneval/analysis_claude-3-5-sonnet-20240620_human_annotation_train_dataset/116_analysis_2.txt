    In this Kata, you have to sort an array of non-negative integers according to

    Here's the implementation of the `sort_array` function based on the provided docstring:
    
        return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(abs(x)).count('1'), x))

CUSTOM ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains two issues:

1. Non-Code Comment in Code:
- The comment `Here's the implementation of the `sort_array` function based on the provided docstring:` does not have a comment symbol in front of it, which causes runtime error.
- To fix this, remove the comment entirely, or add a comment symbol `#` in front of it.

2. Incorrect Indentation:
- The line `return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(abs(x)).count('1'), x))` contains an additional level of indentation compared to the comments in the function description, which causes a indentation error.
- To fix this, remove a level of Indentation from the line so it aligns with the comments in the function description.

TARGET ANALYSIS:
The buggy code contains the following issues:

1. `"Here's the implementation of the `sort_array` function based on the provided docstring:"` should be removed as it's not part of the function implementation.

2. `bin(abs(x))` should be `bin(x)[2:]`. The `abs()` function is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results for negative numbers. Also, we need to remove the '0b' prefix from the binary representation.

3. The sorting order is incorrect. It should first sort by decimal value, then by the number of ones in the binary representation.

To fix these issues:
1. Remove the explanatory text.
2. Use `bin(x)[2:]` instead of `bin(abs(x))`.
3. Change the sorting key to `sorted(sorted(arr), key=lambda x: bin(x)[2:].count('1'))`.
